# Tabular-Data-Formatter-for-Google-Sheets
A browser console script designed to assist users in copying tables from various sources into Google Sheets without the need for manual rewriting. The script takes a table input (multiline strings with tab-separated values) from the user, formats it to the appropriate format, and then copies it to the clipboard ready to be pasted in Google Sheets.
